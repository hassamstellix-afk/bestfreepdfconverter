        <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold">Free personal use</h2>
        <p>
          The toolkit is provided free for personal and reasonable business use
          subject to these terms. Do not abuse the service, attempt to disrupt
          hosting, or scrape the site in a way that harms availability.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Tools are best-effort and browser-based. Output may differ from
          desktop software, especially for complex layouts, scanned documents
          without OCR, macros, charts, or advanced Office formatting. We do not
          guarantee pixel-perfect conversions or uninterrupted availability.

          Passwords and protected files
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unlock / password remover tools only work when you supply the correct
          password for a file you own or are authorized to open. You must not
          use these tools to access documents without permission. We do not
          provide password cracking or bypass of unknown credentials.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold">Your responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for the files you process and for complying with
          applicable laws. Keep backups of important documents before editing.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold">Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          The service is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. To the
          fullest extent permitted by law, {SITE.name} is not liable for data
          loss, inaccurate conversions, or damages arising from use of the
          tools.
